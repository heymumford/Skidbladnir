# Test-Driven Development Approach for Skíðblaðnir

## TDD Tooling Strategy

### TypeScript/Node.js Components
- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **ts-mockito**: For mocking interfaces and dependencies
- **nock**: For HTTP request interception and API simulation
- **supertest**: For API integration testing

### Python Components
- **pytest**: Core testing framework
- **pytest-mock**: For dependency mocking
- **pytest-asyncio**: For async test support
- **responses**: For HTTP mocking
- **hypothesis**: For property-based testing

### Go Components
- **testing**: Standard Go testing package
- **testify**: For assertions and test structuring
- **gomock**: For interface mocking
- **httptest**: For API testing

### Database Testing
- **testcontainers**: For spinning up isolated database instances
- **pg_timetable**: For testing time-dependent processes
- **MockRedis**: For Redis testing

### End-to-End Testing
- **Cypress**: For workflow validation
- **k6**: For performance/load testing
- **Playwright**: For UI verification if needed

### CI Pipeline Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated test runs
- **Codecov**: For test coverage reporting
- **SonarQube**: For code quality analysis

## TDD Implementation Strategy

### 1. Test First Approach
- Write failing tests before implementation
- Use BDD-style specifications where appropriate
- Document expected behavior through tests

### 2. Test Layers
- **Unit Tests**: For individual functions and classes
- **Component Tests**: For bounded contexts and modules
- **Integration Tests**: For cross-component interactions
- **Contract Tests**: For API boundaries
- **E2E Tests**: For complete workflows

### 3. Testing Patterns
- Use test fixtures for standard data
- Implement test data factories
- Create API simulators for Zephyr and qTest
- Use snapshot testing for complex transformations
- Implement property-based testing for data mapping validation

### 4. Special Testing Considerations
- **API Rate Limiting**: Test throttling behavior
- **Failure Recovery**: Verify retry mechanisms
- **Data Volume**: Test with scaled dataset samples
- **Performance**: Validate throughput under load
- **Concurrency**: Test parallel operation safety

### 5. Continuous Testing
- Run fast tests on every commit
- Run integration tests before merges
- Run end-to-end tests nightly
- Perform regular performance testing with scaled datasets

## Development Workflow

1. For each feature:
   - Write test specification first
   - Implement the feature until tests pass
   - Refactor while maintaining test coverage
   - Commit with tests and implementation together

2. For each component:
   - Define clear interfaces through contract tests
   - Enable parallel development through mocks
   - Integrate with real dependencies incrementally

3. For the overall system:
   - Build end-to-end tests for critical paths
   - Create test environments with representative data volumes
   - Validate performance characteristics regularly

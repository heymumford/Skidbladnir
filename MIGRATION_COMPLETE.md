# Migration Complete

The migration from TestBridge to Skidbladnir has been completed successfully. The key changes include:

1. **Consolidated Directory Structure**: All components are now organized under a unified directory structure
2. **Merged Packages**: All packages from both projects have been combined
3. **Documentation**: All documentation has been merged and updated
4. **Infrastructure**: Container definitions have been standardized

## Cleanup Tasks

The following directories can now be safely removed:
- `/TestBridge` - The original TestBridge project that has been fully migrated
- `/backup_*` - Backup directories created during the migration process
- `/merged_temp` - Temporary directory used during migration

## Next Steps

1. Review the updated `README.md` for the combined project features
2. Test the build, deployment, and container scripts with `./scripts/test.sh`
3. Verify that all components work as expected in the new structure
4. Begin development work using the new unified codebase

All features from both projects have been preserved and integrated into a single, coherent structure.

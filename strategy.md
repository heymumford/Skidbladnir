# Skíðblaðnir: Universal Test Asset Migration Strategy

## Purpose

Skíðblaðnir is a flexible migration platform designed to seamlessly transfer test assets between various test management systems. Initially focused on Atlassian Jira/Zephyr to Tricentis qTest migration, the architecture is designed to support multiple source and target systems including HP ALM/Quality Center, Rally, Microsoft Azure DevOps, and Excel-based imports/exports. The system enables organizations to preserve their test knowledge, history, and artifacts while transitioning between test management platforms with minimal disruption to existing testing processes.

## Key Principles

### 1. Data Integrity First
- Maintain complete fidelity of test data during migration
- Preserve relationships between test cases, cycles, executions, and requirements
- Ensure attachment and screenshot content remains intact
- Implement validation at each migration stage

### 2. Scalable Architecture
- Support migration of 100,000+ test items and associated artifacts
- Scale horizontally to handle large attachment datasets
- Implement parallel processing where appropriate
- Design for resume-ability in case of interruption

### 3. API-Friendly Design
- Respect rate limits on both Zephyr and qTest APIs
- Implement adaptive throttling based on API response characteristics
- Use efficient pagination and batching strategies
- Cache frequently accessed, rarely changing resources

### 4. Operational Excellence
- Provide comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Deliver clear progress visibility during migration
- Detect and handle error conditions gracefully
- Support rollback/retry capabilities for resilience

### 5. Maintainable Implementation
- Polyglot architecture using the right tool for each component
- Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
- Extensive test coverage at all levels
- Clear documentation of design decisions

### 6. Containerized Deployment
- Package components as independent containers
- Use Podman for container orchestration
- Support both development and production deployment patterns
- Enable local testing with representative data volumes

## Architecture Overview

Skíðblaðnir implements a plugin-based architecture with a universal translation layer and an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline pattern:

1. **Provider Interface Layer** (TypeScript/Node.js)
   - Standardized interfaces for source/target systems
   - Pluggable adapter pattern for adding new systems
   - Supported systems:
     * Jira/Zephyr API
     * Tricentis qTest API
     * HP ALM/Quality Center
     * Microsoft Azure DevOps
     * Rally
     * Excel import/export

2. **Extractors** (TypeScript/Node.js)
   - Connect to source system APIs through provider interfaces
   - Retrieve test assets efficiently
   - Handle pagination and rate limiting
   - Stream binary content to object storage

3. **Universal Translation Layer** (TypeScript)
   - Define canonical data models for test assets
   - Provider-agnostic intermediate representation
   - Bidirectional mapping capabilities
   - Translation rules engine

4. **Binary Content Processor** (Go)
   - Efficiently process image and attachment data
   - Handle compression and format conversions
   - Manage temporary storage of binary assets
   - Ensure data integrity with checksums

5. **Loaders** (TypeScript/Node.js)
   - Create corresponding structures in target systems
   - Upload transformed test assets
   - Maintain references and relationships
   - Respect target API limitations

6. **Orchestration Service** (Python)
   - Manage the overall migration workflow
   - Track migration state and progress
   - Handle failures and retries
   - Provide operational dashboards

7. **Storage Layer**
   - PostgreSQL for migration state and metadata
   - Redis for caching and coordination
   - MinIO for temporary binary storage

8. **Containerized Runtime**
   - Self-contained Podman-based deployment
   - No external dependencies beyond containers
   - Consistent development and production environments
   - Automated build pipeline for container images

## Approach to Test-Driven Development

Skíðblaðnir will be built using strict TDD practices across all components:

1. Unit tests for individual components with high coverage
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. End-to-end tests for complete migration workflows
4. Performance tests for scalability validation
5. Mock APIs to simulate both source and target systems

This approach ensures that quality is built into the system from the beginning, resulting in a robust and reliable migration tool.

# Rate Limiter Implementation Summary

As part of the Kanban task "Test: Rate limiter functions under various scenarios", we have implemented and tested comprehensive rate limiting functionality for the API Bridge component.

## Components Implemented

1. **Enhanced Core Rate Limiter Tests**
   - Added comprehensive test scenarios for the core RateLimiter class
   - Tests cover adaptive delays, timeout handling, backoff strategies, and reset functionality
   - Improved mocking for date/time to reliably test time-dependent behavior

2. **API Bridge Rate Limiter**
   - Created `ApiRateLimiter` class in the API Bridge to integrate with the core RateLimiter
   - Implemented provider-specific rate limiting configurations
   - Added support for various rate limit response headers and status codes
   - Created Axios interceptors for seamless integration with HTTP clients

3. **Rate Limiter Factory**
   - Implemented a factory for easily getting configured rate limiters for different providers
   - Pre-configured optimized settings for common test management providers (Rally, Azure DevOps, Jira, etc.)
   - Singleton pattern to ensure consistent rate limiter instances across the application

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Created tests demonstrating how the rate limiter integrates with HTTP clients
   - Tests for handling rate limit responses with different header formats
   - Tests for tracking request counts during burst operations

5. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Added comprehensive README with usage examples
   - Created an example provider client implementation
   - Documented provider-specific configurations and customization options

## Key Features

- Adaptive delays based on request volume
- Automatic backoff when approaching rate limits
- Header-based reset time extraction
- Support for different rate limit response patterns across providers
- Seamless integration with Axios HTTP clients
- Provider-specific rate limit configurations
- Metrics tracking for monitoring rate limit usage

## Next Steps

The rate limiter implementation is ready for use in the API Bridge and provider implementations. The next tasks would be:

1. Integrate the rate limiter with specific provider implementations (Rally, Azure DevOps, etc.)
2. Add logging capabilities for better monitoring of rate limit behavior
3. Implement analytics for tracking rate limit metrics over time

With this implementation, we have successfully completed the Kanban task "Test: Rate limiter functions under various scenarios" and updated the Kanban board accordingly.

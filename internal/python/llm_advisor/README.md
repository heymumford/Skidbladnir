# LLM Advisor for API Integration

## Overview

The LLM Advisor is a specialized AI assistant designed to help with API integration challenges, particularly focusing on Zephyr Scale and qTest APIs. It provides intelligent assistance for troubleshooting, workflow optimization, and migration between test management systems.

## Key Components

- **Core LLM Assistant**: Base assistant with error analysis, remediation, and code generation capabilities
- **Provider-Specific Advisors**: Specialized knowledge for Zephyr and qTest APIs
- **Migration Advisor**: Expert guidance for Zephyr to qTest migration workflows

## Features

### Error Analysis and Remediation

- Identify root causes of API errors
- Generate step-by-step remediation instructions
- Provide plain language explanations for non-technical users
- Suggest code examples for handling specific error types

### Workflow Optimization

- Identify optimization opportunities in API workflows
- Suggest parallel execution, caching, and batching strategies
- Recommend improved operation sequencing
- Provider-specific optimization recommendations

### Migration Assistance

- Field mapping recommendations between systems
- Migration workflow design and optimization
- Error analysis during migration process
- Progress tracking and reporting

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from llm_advisor.services.llm_assistant import LLMAssistant

# Initialize and load the model
assistant = LLMAssistant()
assistant.load_model()

# Analyze an API error
error_data = {
    "status_code": 401,
    "message": "Authentication failed",
    "endpoint": "/api/v1/test-cases"
}

analysis = assistant.analyze_error(error_data)
print(f"Error Type: {analysis.error_type}")
print(f"Root Cause: {analysis.root_cause}")

# Generate remediation steps
steps = assistant.generate_remediation_steps(analysis)
for step in steps:
    print(f"- {step.step}: {step.details}")

# Generate code example for handling this error
code = assistant.generate_code_example("javascript", "authentication")
print(code)
```

### Using Provider-Specific Advisors

```python
from llm_advisor.providers.zephyr_advisor import ZephyrApiAdvisor
from llm_advisor.providers.qtest_advisor import QTestApiAdvisor

# Initialize provider-specific advisors
zephyr_advisor = ZephyrApiAdvisor()
qtest_advisor = QTestApiAdvisor()

# Analyze Zephyr-specific error
zephyr_error = {
    "status_code": 401,
    "message": "JWT expired at 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
zephyr_analysis = zephyr_advisor.analyze_zephyr_error(zephyr_error)

# Get qTest-specific remediation steps
qtest_steps = qtest_advisor.get_qtest_remediation_steps(analysis)
```

### Using the Migration Advisor

```python
from llm_advisor.providers.migration_advisor import MigrationAdvisor

# Initialize migration advisor
migration_advisor = MigrationAdvisor()

# Get field mapping recommendations
source_fields = ["name", "description", "priority", "labels"]
target_fields = ["name", "description", "Priority", "tags"]
mapping = migration_advisor.generate_field_mapping_recommendation(
    source_fields, target_fields
)

# Design migration workflow
workflow = migration_advisor.suggest_migration_workflow(migration_config)

# Generate user-friendly progress update
update = migration_advisor.generate_migration_progress_update(progress_data)
print(update)
```

## Model Deployment

The LLM Advisor supports multiple deployment options:

1. **Embedded Mode**: Run directly within the application
2. **Dedicated Container**: Run in a separate container with dedicated resources
3. **Clustered Mode**: Distribute model across multiple containers for higher throughput

## Security Considerations

- All processing occurs locally - no data sent to external services
- No outbound network access required
- No usage telemetry
- No persistent storage of sensitive information

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, 8 CPU cores
- Optional: CUDA-compatible GPU for faster inference

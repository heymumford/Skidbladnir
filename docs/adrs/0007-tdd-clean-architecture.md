## Status

## Context

Skíðblaðnir is a complex system with many moving parts, multiple integration points, and a diverse technology stack. We need to ensure that the system is robust, maintainable, and adheres strictly to Clean Architecture principles. We also need to ensure that all components work together correctly while maintaining architectural integrity.

Traditional development approaches often lead to architectural drift, where the implemented code gradually deviates from the intended architecture. This can result in technical debt, maintenance challenges, and difficulty in extending the system. Additionally, without a structured testing approach, there's a risk of insufficient test coverage, especially at architectural boundaries.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for all components of Skíðblaðnir, with a specific focus on using tests to enforce Clean Architecture principles. This approach will involve writing tests before implementation for all system components, from the domain layer to the infrastructure layer.

### Key Principles

1. **Test-First Development**: All code must have tests written before implementation.
2. **Clean Architecture Validation through Tests**: Tests will explicitly validate adherence to architectural boundaries.
3. **Layered Testing Strategy**: Tests will be organized according to Clean Architecture layers.
4. **Contract Testing for Plugins**: Provider plugins will be tested against well-defined contracts.
5. **Acceptance Tests as Specifications**: User requirements will be captured as executable acceptance tests.

### Testing Layers Aligned with Clean Architecture

#### 1. Domain Layer Testing
- Tests for entities, value objects, and domain services
- Tests for business rules and invariants
- Pure domain logic tested in isolation from infrastructure

#### 2. Use Case / Application Layer Testing
- Tests for use cases and application services
- Validating orchestration of domain entities
- Mocking out infrastructure dependencies
- Testing application-specific business rules

#### 3. Interface Adapter Testing
- Tests for controllers, presenters, and gateways
- Validating correct translation between domain and external formats
- Testing adapter-specific logic
- Ensuring adapters respect architectural boundaries

#### 4. Infrastructure Layer Testing
- Tests for repositories, API clients, and other infrastructure
- Testing against interface contracts defined in the adapter layer
- Integration tests for real infrastructure behavior

### Plugin Testing Strategy

#### 1. Provider Interface Contracts
- Define test contracts that all providers must satisfy
- Create shared test suites that all provider implementations must pass
- Test provider-specific extensions

#### 2. Mock Providers for Testing
- Implement mock providers for testing use cases
- Create test doubles for all provider interfaces
- Use mock providers in higher-level tests

### Boundary Testing

#### 1. Architecture Boundary Tests
- Tests that explicitly verify that architectural boundaries are respected
- Validate that domain doesn't depend on infrastructure
- Ensure use cases only interact with domain entities and port interfaces

#### 2. Integration Tests Across Boundaries
- Test communication between architectural layers
- Verify data transformation across boundaries
- Test complete flows across the system

## Implementation Details

1. **Test Frameworks and Tools**:
   - Jest for TypeScript components
   - React Testing Library for UI components
   - Pytest for Python components
   - Go testing framework for Go components
   - Cucumber for BDD-style acceptance tests

2. **Test Structure**:
   - Tests organized by architectural layer
   - Test files co-located with implementation files
   - Shared test fixtures and helpers for each layer

3. **Test-First Workflow**:
   - Define acceptance criteria as executable tests
   - Write tests for domain entities before implementation
   - Write adapter interface tests before implementation
   - Write infrastructure tests against adapter interfaces
   - Implement to make tests pass, then refactor

4. **Continuous Testing**:
   - All tests run on every commit
   - Strict enforcement of test coverage thresholds
   - Test performance monitoring
   - Test quality reviews

5. **Test Documentation**:
   - Document architectural validations in tests
   - Document test fixtures and helpers
   - Document test patterns for each layer

## Consequences

### Positive

- Ensures architectural integrity through executable tests
- Provides rapid feedback on architectural violations
- Leads to more maintainable, better-designed code
- Facilitates safe refactoring and evolution
- Provides comprehensive test coverage
- Creates living documentation of the system
- Enables confident extension of the system
- Reduces debugging and maintenance costs

### Negative

- Requires more upfront investment in test infrastructure
- May slow down initial development velocity
- Requires discipline and commitment from all team members
- Increases the amount of code to maintain (test code)
- May require more complex test setups for some scenarios

### Neutral

- Changes the development workflow
- Requires a shift in thinking about how to design and implement features
- May require additional training for team members unfamiliar with TDD

## Implementation Notes

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Establish testing frameworks and infrastructure
2. Create test templates for each architectural layer
3. Define test coverage thresholds
4. Set up continuous integration for tests

### 2. Layer-by-Layer Implementation

1. Begin with domain entity tests and implementations
2. Move to use case tests and implementations
3. Implement adapter interfaces and tests
4. Implement infrastructure components against adapter tests

### 3. Test Quality Assurance

1. Regular test code reviews
2. Test refactoring sessions
3. Test documentation standards
4. Test performance optimization

### 4. Metrics and Monitoring

1. Track test coverage by architectural layer
2. Monitor test execution time
3. Track test-to-code ratio
4. Analyze failed tests and fix times

# ADR 0012: API Testing and Validation Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-04-09

## Context

Skíðblaðnir integrates with multiple third-party test management systems through their APIs. Each API has its own characteristics, authentication requirements, rate limits, response structures, and potential edge cases. We need a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure our provider adapters can reliably interact with these APIs without introducing failures into the migration process.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-faceted API testing and validation strategy with the following components:

### 1. API Connectivity Testing

We will develop lightweight, command-line executable scripts for testing connectivity with each provider API:

- **Purpose**: Verify API access, credentials, and proper response parsing
- **Implementation**: Node.js scripts with minimal dependencies
- **Invocation**: Both manual (via npm scripts) and automated (CI/CD)
- **Example**: `test-zephyr-connectivity.js` script for Zephyr Scale API

```javascript
// Example API connectivity test sequence
async function main() {
  // Test connection to API
  await testConnection();
  
  // Get test assets
  const testCases = await getTestCases();
  
  // Get details of specific entities
  await getTestCaseDetails(testCases);
  
  // Get test cycles and executions
  await getTestCycles();
  await getTestExecutions();
}
```

### 2. Provider Interface Contract Testing

- Contract tests to verify provider implementations conform to interface specifications
- Tests run against both live APIs and mocked responses
- Each method in the provider interface will have corresponding tests

### 3. API Rate Limiting Tests

- Tests to verify proper handling of API rate limits
- Simulated high-throughput scenarios
- Rate limiting backoff and retry mechanism validation

### 4. Error Handling and Resilience Testing

- Tests for all error codes and exception cases
- Network interruption simulations
- Authentication failure and token refresh scenarios
- Validation of error categorization and recovery mechanisms

### 5. Data Type Handling Tests

- Exhaustive testing of all data types (strings, numbers, dates, booleans, arrays, objects)
- Special character handling in text fields
- Timestamp and timezone handling
- Binary content and attachment testing

### 6. Mock API Service for Integration Testing

- Implementation of mock services for each provider API
- Consistent response format simulation
- Controlled error injection
- Performance simulation

## Consequences

### Positive

- Early detection of API compatibility issues
- Confidence in provider implementations
- Better handling of edge cases and error scenarios
- Simplified manual testing of API connectivity
- Improved developer experience for provider implementation

### Negative

- Additional maintenance burden for test scripts and mock services
- Need to keep tests in sync with third-party API changes
- Potential false negatives due to environment or network issues

### Neutral

- Need to balance comprehensive testing with execution time
- Challenge of simulating all possible API behaviors
- Requires careful credential management for tests

## Implementation Notes

1. **API Connectivity Scripts**:
   - Implemented in the `scripts/` directory
   - Documented in the scripts README
   - Available as npm scripts (`npm run test:zephyr`, etc.)
   - Include proper error handling and verbose output options

2. **Test Organization**:
   - Provider-specific tests in `tests/providers/{provider-name}/`
   - Common test utilities in `tests/common/`
   - Integration tests across providers in `tests/integration/`

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Run contract tests on every PR affecting providers
   - Run connectivity tests nightly with secured credentials
   - Run performance and rate limit tests in dedicated environment

4. **Documentation**:
   - Each provider will document its API testing strategy
   - Create comprehensive troubleshooting guide for API issues
   - Maintain list of known API limitations and workarounds

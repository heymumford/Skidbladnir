# ADR 0014: LCARS-Inspired UI Design Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Skidbladnir application needed a beautiful and elegant user interface for migrating test cases between Zephyr Scale and qTest systems. A clear, intuitive, and visually distinctive UI was required to guide users through the migration process while providing immediate visual feedback on system status.

After evaluating several design approaches, we considered that a distinctive and recognizable interface would help differentiate the product while providing excellent usability. The LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) design language from Star Trek offered an opportunity to create a unique yet functional UI that provides clear visual hierarchy and status indications.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a UI design language inspired by Star Trek's LCARS interface with the following key features:

1. **Asymmetric Panel Design**: Distinctive panels with color blocks along one side to create visual hierarchy
2. **Rounded UI Elements**: Generous border radii on containers, buttons, and interactive elements
3. **Status Indicators**: Blinking lights and color-coded status elements that communicate system state
4. **Distinctive Color Palette**: High-contrast colors that indicate function and status
5. **Step-by-Step Workflow**: A guided wizard approach for the migration process
6. **Modular Component Structure**: Components composed together to create complex interfaces

The implementation leverages Material UI as the foundation, with custom styled components created with the styled API to achieve the LCARS aesthetic while maintaining full functionality.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Visual Distinctiveness**: The UI is immediately recognizable and distinctive
2. **Clear Status Indications**: The blinking indicators and color-coding provide immediate visual feedback
3. **Intuitive Information Hierarchy**: The asymmetric panels naturally guide the eye to important information
4. **Streamlined User Flow**: The step-by-step wizard process breaks down complex operations into manageable steps
5. **Enhanced User Experience**: The distinctive design creates a more engaging and memorable user experience

### Potential Challenges

1. **Learning Curve**: Users may need time to adapt to the non-standard UI patterns
2. **Maintenance Complexity**: The custom styled components will require maintenance alongside Material UI updates
3. **Theme Consistency**: Ensuring consistent application of the design system across all components
4. **Accessibility Considerations**: Care must be taken to ensure all custom components meet accessibility requirements

## Implementation Notes

The implementation includes:

1. **MigrationWizard Component**: A 5-step wizard guiding users through the migration process
2. **Provider Configuration Panels**: Specialized panels for Zephyr and qTest configuration
3. **Field Mapping Interface**: Visual tools for mapping fields between systems
4. **Transformation Preview**: Real-time preview of transformations with visual diff views
5. **Execution Controls**: Playback-style controls for pausing, resuming, and cancelling migrations
6. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time feedback with LCARS-style indicators for operation status

All components are designed for reusability, with clean separation of presentation and functionality. The design system is implemented through a set of styled components that can be composed to create consistent interfaces throughout the application.

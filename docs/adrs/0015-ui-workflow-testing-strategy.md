# ADR 0015: UI Workflow Testing Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Date

## Context

As the Skíðblaðnir project matures, we need a comprehensive testing strategy for the UI workflows. This is especially important as the application now supports multiple provider combinations (Zephyr, qTest, TestRail, Micro Focus ALM, Jama, Azure DevOps, Rally, Visure) and complex operations like field mapping, attachment handling, and internationalization.

The LCARS UI implementation (ADR 0014) introduced a sophisticated user interface with complex interactive elements. While we have unit tests for individual components, we need end-to-end workflow testing that validates the entire user journey across different provider combinations.

Traditional unit and integration tests alone are insufficient to catch issues in the complete user workflow. UI testing approaches like Cypress or Selenium would be too heavyweight for our needs and wouldn't integrate well with our acceptance testing framework.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive UI workflow testing strategy using behavior-driven development (BDD) with Cucumber.js. Key aspects of this approach include:

1. **Feature Files with Provider Combinations**: Create feature files that define scenarios for all supported provider combinations, with parameterized testing to cover the matrix of source and target systems.

2. **Scenario Categories**:
   - End-to-end migration workflows
   - Error handling during connections
   - Operational controls (pause/resume/cancel)
   - Custom field transformations
   - Attachment handling
   - Internationalization support

3. **Mock Provider Integration**: Use mock implementations of provider APIs for testing to ensure tests are deterministic and don't require external services.

4. **Context-Rich World Object**: Extend the Cucumber World object to maintain UI state, provider connections, field mappings, and other context needed for complex UI workflows.

5. **Declarative Step Definitions**: Create step definitions that focus on business logic rather than implementation details.

6. **Tagged Scenarios**: Use tags to categorize tests for specific use cases (@workflow, @providers, @error-handling, @internationalization).

## Consequences

### Positive

- Provides comprehensive testing of UI workflows across all provider combinations
- Ensures that the migration process works correctly in all supported scenarios
- Creates living documentation of supported workflows and features
- Validates complex user journeys from start to finish
- Improves test coverage for LCARS UI components
- Enables focused testing of specific aspects like error handling or internationalization

### Negative

- Increases complexity of the testing framework
- Requires ongoing maintenance as new providers are added
- Mock implementations may diverge from actual provider behavior over time

### Neutral

- Affects development workflow by requiring UI workflow tests for new features
- Test runs may take longer to execute the full matrix of provider combinations

## Implementation Notes

1. **Test Structure**:
   - Place tests in `/tests/acceptance/features/ui/` directory
   - Use appropriate subdirectories for related features
   - Use descriptive, domain-focused names for feature files

2. **Step Implementation**:
   - Create clear, reusable step definitions
   - Use descriptive, business-focused language
   - Keep technical implementation details hidden from feature files

3. **World Object**:
   - Extend the Cucumber World to maintain UI state
   - Create helper methods for common operations
   - Include detailed context for provider connections, field mappings, etc.

4. **Mock Data**:
   - Create realistic test data for each provider
   - Define standard mock responses for different test scenarios
   - Maintain consistency in mock data across tests

5. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Tests should validate each provider combination
   - Tests should cover all major UI workflows
   - Tests should include error handling and edge cases
   - Tests should support internationalization testing

6. **Future Extensions**:
   - Visual testing for LCARS UI components
   - Performance testing for UI operations
   - Accessibility testing for UI components

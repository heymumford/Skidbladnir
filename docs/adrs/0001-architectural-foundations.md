# ADR 0001: Architectural Foundations for Skíðblaðnir

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-04-09

## Context

Skíðblaðnir aims to provide a solution for migrating test assets between various test management systems. The architecture must handle complex API interactions, large data volumes, diverse system interfaces, and maintain data integrity throughout the migration process.

## Decision

We will adopt a plugin-based, polyglot architecture with a universal translation layer based on the following foundations:

### 1. Core Architectural Patterns

- **Hexagonal/Ports and Adapters Architecture**: Clear separation between domain logic and external systems
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible design for adding new test management system providers
- **ETL Pipeline**: Extract-Transform-Load pattern for migration workflows
- **CQRS-inspired**: Separation of read (extraction) and write (loading) operations

### 2. Package Structure

```

### 3. Component Architecture

1. **Provider Interface Layer**: 
   - Standard adapter interfaces for all test management systems
   - Pluggable implementation for each supported system
   - Versioned API contract

2. **Universal Translation Layer**:
   - System-agnostic canonical data model
   - Bidirectional mapping between systems
   - Data integrity validation

3. **API Bridge**:
   - Handles multi-stage API interactions
   - Manages authentication and session state
   - Implements rate limiting and throttling
   - Provides self-healing capabilities for API errors

4. **Local LLM Assistant**:
   - Containerized, privacy-focused LLM
   - API troubleshooting capabilities
   - Workflow optimization
   - Error recovery suggestions

5. **Orchestration Service**:
   - Manages migration workflow
   - Tracks progress and state
   - Handles error recovery
   - Provides reporting and monitoring

6. **Binary Content Processor**:
   - Efficient processing of attachments/images
   - Optimized for performance with Go
   - Manages temporary storage

### 4. Technology Stack

- **TypeScript/Node.js**: API clients, transformers, provider interfaces
- **Python**: Orchestration service, workflow management
- **Go**: High-performance binary processing
- **PostgreSQL**: State tracking, mapping storage
- **Redis**: Caching, coordination
- **MinIO**: Object storage for binary data

### 5. Deployment Model

- **Containerized Components**: All services deployed in containers
- **Podman-based**: Container orchestration using Podman
- **Environment Parity**: Consistent environments from development to production

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of concerns through a modular architecture
- Extensibility through the plugin system for new providers
- Self-healing capability to handle API issues
- Privacy-focused design with local processing
- Scalability to handle large migration volumes

### Negative

- Increased complexity from polyglot architecture
- Multiple technologies to maintain
- Learning curve for contributors

### Neutral

- Need for comprehensive testing across component boundaries
- Additional coordination overhead between different languages
- Dependency management across language ecosystems

## Implementation Notes

1. **Interface Stability**:
   - Provider interfaces must remain stable
   - Versioning for any breaking changes
   - Migration path for plugin adapters

2. **Deployment Requirements**:
   - Podman 3.x+ for container orchestration
   - No other dependencies on host systems

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Each component must have comprehensive unit tests
   - Integration tests for component boundaries
   - End-to-end tests for complete migration workflows
   - Mocks for external API dependencies

## Date

## Context

API integration with test management systems presents complex troubleshooting challenges. Users need guidance when API errors occur, workflows fail, or mappings need adjustment. While documentation helps, a more intelligent assistant would significantly improve the user experience and success rate of migrations.

## Decision

We will implement a Local LLM Assistant with the following architecture:

### 1. Core Components

1. **Quantized LLM Engine**:
   - Uses smaller, efficient models like Llama-3 (7B) or similar
   - Optimized for local execution with reasonable resources
   - Quantized for performance (4-bit or 8-bit precision)

2. **Knowledge Base**:
   - Specialized corpus of API documentation
   - Test management system knowledge
   - Error patterns and solutions
   - Indexed for efficient retrieval

3. **API Schema Registry**:
   - Parser and storage for OpenAPI specifications
   - Entity relationship mapping
   - Dependency graphs for API operations

4. **Inference Pipeline**:
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Context-aware document retrieval
   - Dynamic prompt construction
   - Multi-step reasoning

5. **Integration Interface**:
   - API for error analysis
   - Workflow optimization suggestions
   - Documentation generation
   - Interactive troubleshooting

### 2. Containerized Deployment

- Self-contained container with no external dependencies
- No internet access for privacy and security
- Resource-efficient configuration
- GPU acceleration when available (optional)

### 3. Use Cases

1. **API Troubleshooting**:
   - Error diagnosis and explanation
   - Suggested remediation steps
   - Alternative approach generation

2. **Workflow Optimization**:
   - Analysis of API operation sequences
   - Suggestions for improved ordering
   - Identification of unnecessary operations

3. **Documentation Assistance**:
   - Generation of system-specific guides
   - Explanation of complex workflows
   - Conversion of technical details to plain language

4. **Interactive Guidance**:
   - Question answering about APIs
   - Step-by-step guides for complex tasks
   - Code example generation

### 4. Integration Points

- **Error Recovery Engine**: For API error analysis
- **Workflow Orchestration**: For migration plan optimization
- **User Interface**: For interactive help and documentation
- **Provider Interface**: For system-specific guidance

## Consequences

### Positive

- Enhanced user experience through intelligent assistance
- Improved troubleshooting capabilities for complex issues
- Reduced time-to-resolution for API errors
- Privacy-preserving design with local processing
- Specialized knowledge about test management systems

### Negative

- Additional resource requirements for LLM execution
- Development and maintenance of specialized model
- Potential limitations of smaller, quantized models

### Neutral

- Need for ongoing knowledge base updates
- Balance between model size and performance
- Varying utility based on problem complexity

## Implementation Notes

1. **Model Selection Criteria**:
   - Open source LLM with permissive license
   - Suitable for running on modest hardware (16GB RAM minimum)
   - Strong reasoning capabilities for complex problems
   - Efficient inference with quantization

2. **Knowledge Engineering**:
   - Curated corpus of documentation for all supported systems
   - Structured knowledge of common error patterns
   - Example-based learning for API workflows
   - Regular updates to maintain accuracy

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Configurable resource limits
   - Optional offloading to GPU
   - Startup/shutdown optimization
   - Caching of common queries

4. **Security and Privacy**:
   - No external API calls from LLM container
   - No persistent storage of sensitive information
   - Isolation from production credentials
   - Transparent operation for user trust

5. **Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Response time under 2 seconds for common queries
   - Support for context window of at least 8K tokens
   - Memory footprint under 16GB for CPU inference

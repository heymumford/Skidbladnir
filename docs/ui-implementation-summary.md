   - Added security and compliance phase

2. **UI Test Plan**
   - Created comprehensive test-driven development plan
   - Defined test categories (unit, integration, end-to-end)
   - Provided detailed test examples for key components
   - Outlined component documentation standards

3. **Project Setup**
   - Created React project structure with TypeScript
   - Set up testing infrastructure (Jest, React Testing Library)
   - Configured Storybook for component development
   - Added Material UI for component library
   - Created Docker and Nginx configuration for containerization

4. **Core UI Components**
   - Implemented main application layout with tests
   - Created navigation bar component with tests
   - Implemented activity log panel with tests
   - Created status bar component with tests
   - Set up context providers for logs and migrations

5. **Star Trek LCARS-Inspired Status Interfaces**
   - Created LCARS-style status header component with tests
   - Implemented customizable status window with real-time updates
   - Added export and clipboard integration for status logs
   - Implemented customizable display formats and layouts
   - Added visual state indicators and stardate display
   - Created blinking TX/RX indicators with data counters
   - Implemented byte counters with auto-formatting (B, KB, MB, GB)
   - Added real-time data transfer indicators

6. **Type Definitions**
   - Defined comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all entities
   - Created types for providers, mappings, migrations, and more
   - Added API response type definitions

7. **Security Documentation**
   - Created security audit guidelines document
   - Outlined data handling questionnaire for corporate auditors
   - Documented security implementation status tracking
   - Added compliance and regulations section

## Next Implementation Steps

Following the Kanban board and TDD approach, the next steps are:

1. **UI Foundation Completion**
   - Create core UI component library (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
   - Implement theme system with consistent styling
   - Add responsive design support

2. **Provider Configuration Implementation**
   - Create provider selection components with tests
   - Implement connection forms with validation
   - Add connection testing functionality

3. **Mapping Interface Implementation**
   - Create field display components
   - Implement visual mapping interface
   - Add transformation rule editor

4. **Execution Control Implementation**
   - Create migration configuration forms
   - Implement execution control panel
   - Add migration preview functionality

5. **Security Implementation**
   - Implement credential encryption system
   - Develop audit logging for all operations
   - Create secure API communications
   - Implement temporary data encryption

## Development Workflow

The implementation will follow this TDD workflow:

1. Select the next test task from the Kanban board
2. Write the test that defines the component's expected behavior
3. Implement the minimal component to pass the test
4. Refactor and enhance as needed
5. Create a Storybook story for the component
6. Move to the next test task

## UI Architecture

The UI implementation follows a clean architecture with:

- **Component-based design**: Small, focused, reusable components
- **Separation of concerns**: Layout, logic, and styling are separated
- **Context-based state management**: React contexts for global state
- **API abstraction**: Service layer for backend communication
- **Consistent styling**: Theme-based design system

The layout follows the design specified in ADR-0006 with:
- Navigation bar for main section navigation
- Split-pane design with main workspace and activity log
- Status bar for migration progress and system status
- LCARS-inspired status interfaces for input/output windows

## Star Trek LCARS-Inspired Interfaces

The Star Trek-inspired LCARS interfaces include:
- Status headers with operation name, state, and stardate
- Real-time progress indicators with estimated time remaining
- Transaction status tracking with visual indicators
- Customizable log displays with multiple layout options
- Clipboard integration for copying status information
- Export functionality for saving logs to files
- Search capability for filtering log content
- Blinking TX/RX indicators with red and green status lights
- Real-time byte counters showing data transfer amounts
- Auto-formatting of byte sizes (B, KB, MB, GB)
- Visual indicators of active data transfers

## Testing Strategy

All components are developed with tests first, including:
- **Rendering tests**: Verify components render correctly
- **Interaction tests**: Verify components respond to user actions
- **Integration tests**: Verify components work together
- **API tests**: Verify correct backend communication

## Security Considerations

Security-first approach with:
- Comprehensive security audit documentation
- Data handling guidelines for corporate approval
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Secure credential management
- Audit logging of all operations
- Compliance with regulations like GDPR

## Containerization

The UI is containerized with:
- Multi-stage Docker build for optimized image size
- Nginx for serving the static assets
- API proxying for backend communication
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

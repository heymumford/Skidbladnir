# Comprehensive Test Pyramid for Skidbladnir

This document outlines the test pyramid approach for the Skidbladnir project, focusing on ensuring robust testing across all provider adapters, including Micro Focus ALM (formerly HP ALM), TestRail, Jama Software, and Visure Solutions.

## Test Pyramid Overview

The test pyramid is a concept that helps balance testing efforts across different levels of abstraction, ensuring both thorough coverage and efficient test execution. Our approach follows these layers:

```
      /\
     /  \
    /    \  Acceptance Tests (User Perspective)
   /      \
  /        \
 /          \  System Tests (Validation)
/            \
--------------
|            |
|            |  Integration Tests (Verification)
|            |
--------------
|            |
|            |
|            |  Unit Tests (Foundation)
|            |
|            |

```

## Test Pyramid Layers

### Unit Tests (Foundation)

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, typically mocking or stubbing dependencies.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Provider adapter authentication and connection management
- Error handling and error categorization
- Data type conversions and field mapping
- Rate limiting handling
- Resource management

**Testing Approach:**
- Mock external dependencies and API responses
- Test all error scenarios systematically
- Verify correct error classification and messages
- Ensure proper conversion between provider-specific formats and canonical models
- Test connection lifecycle (establishment, maintenance, timeout, reconnection)

### Integration Tests (Verification)

Integration tests verify that components work correctly when connected to each other, focusing on the boundaries between systems.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Provider adapter integration with transformation layer
- API contract validation
- Cross-provider transformation correctness
- Error propagation between layers
- Authentication token management
- Rate limiting behavior with actual API patterns

**Testing Approach:**
- Use API mocking tools like Karate to simulate provider APIs
- Test transformations between different provider formats
- Verify error handling across component boundaries
- Test with realistic but controlled data sets

### System Tests (Validation)

System tests validate end-to-end workflows, ensuring the entire system works together correctly.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Cross-provider migration workflows
- Attachment handling across providers
- Performance under various loads
- Resiliency under degraded network conditions
- Multi-provider orchestration

**Testing Approach:**
- Create end-to-end test scenarios covering full migration paths
- Test with large datasets and attachments
- Simulate network issues and verify recovery
- Benchmark performance across different provider combinations
- Test parallel operations and concurrency handling

### Acceptance Tests (User Perspective)

Acceptance tests validate that the system meets user requirements from an external perspective.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Full user workflows through the UI
- Internationalization and localization
- Accessibility compliance
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Installation and configuration experience

**Testing Approach:**
- Use behavior-driven development with Cucumber
- Create user-focused scenarios
- Test across multiple browsers and devices
- Verify accessibility compliance using automation tools
- Test installation workflows on different platforms

## Provider-Specific Testing Considerations

### Micro Focus ALM (formerly HP ALM)

- Authentication methods (basic, SAML, API key, OAuth)
- Domain and project structure navigation
- Test folder hierarchy preservation
- Special handling of attachments and rich text fields
- Handling of custom fields and extensions

### TestRail

- API key authentication and session management
- Test case structure including sections and suites
- Custom field mappings
- Milestone and run data handling
- Attachment size limitations
- Special test steps formatting

### Jama Software

- OAuth token management
- Item type hierarchy preservation
- Relationship mapping between items
- Requirements traceability
- Document versioning support
- Rich text field conversion

### Visure Solutions

- Authentication and session handling
- Requirements structure preservation
- Relationships between requirements
- Traceability matrix conversion
- Document attachment handling
- Custom field mapping

## Automation Strategy

1. **Continuous Integration Pipelines:**
   - Run unit and integration tests on every PR
   - Run system tests daily
   - Run full acceptance test suite weekly and before releases

2. **Test Data Management:**
   - Maintain fixtures for all provider formats
   - Create transformation verification datasets
   - Build realistic but anonymized test data

3. **Mocking Strategy:**
   - Use Karate for API mocking
   - Create provider-specific mock servers
   - Record and replay real API interactions

4. **Reporting and Metrics:**
   - Track test coverage by provider and layer
   - Monitor test execution times
   - Report on feature coverage across providers

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Provider Adapter Tests:**
   - Each provider must have a dedicated test suite covering all standard operations
   - Authentication tests must handle all supported auth methods
   - Error handling must be thoroughly tested for each operation
   - Field mapping tests must cover all supported field types

2. **Cross-Provider Tests:**
   - Test migration between every supported provider pair
   - Verify data integrity across transformations
   - Test attachment handling between different providers
   - Verify that provider-specific metadata is preserved where applicable

3. **Performance Tests:**
   - Test with increasing volumes of test cases
   - Measure throughput and response times
   - Test concurrent operations
   - Verify memory usage under load

## Contribution Guidelines for Tests

When contributing provider adapter implementations or tests:

1. **Unit Tests Requirements:**
   - Test all standard operations (connection, authentication, CRUD)
   - Test all error scenarios
   - Test field mapping for all supported field types
   - Test rate limiting and retry behavior

2. **Integration Test Requirements:**
   - Create Karate mock definitions for the provider API
   - Test adapter with transformation layer
   - Create API contract validations
   - Test error propagation

3. **Documentation:**
   - Document provider-specific quirks or limitations
   - Create examples of common operations
   - Document authentication requirements
   - Update test coverage reports

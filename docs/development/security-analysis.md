# Security Analysis in Skíðblaðnir

This document describes the security analysis tools and practices used in Skíðblaðnir, with a particular focus on CodeQL implementation.

## Overview

Skíðblaðnir employs multiple layers of security scanning:

1. **CodeQL** - For static code analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities in source code
2. **Trivy** - For container and dependency scanning
3. **OWASP Dependency Check** - For known vulnerability detection in dependencies
4. **ESLint Security Plugin** - For TypeScript/JavaScript security linting

This comprehensive approach helps identify potential security issues early in the development process.

## CodeQL Implementation

### What is CodeQL?

CodeQL is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine that allows you to discover vulnerabilities and errors in your code. It treats code as data, allowing you to query and analyze codebases to find security issues.

### How It's Implemented

Skíðblaðnir uses CodeQL through GitHub Actions with the following components:

1. **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`
   - Configures when and how CodeQL runs
   - Set up for TypeScript, Python, and Go analysis
   - Scheduled to run weekly and on PRs to main branches

2. **Configuration File**: `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`
   - Specifies which query packs to run
   - Configures path inclusions and exclusions
   - Sets query filters to reduce noise

3. **Integration with GitHub Security**:
   - Results are displayed in the "Security" tab of the repository
   - Alerts are created for identified issues
   - PRs show security scan results

### Supported Languages

Skíðblaðnir's CodeQL implementation covers all major languages in the codebase:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - For the API and UI components
- **Python** - For the orchestrator and LLM components
- **Go** - For the binary processor

### Query Packs

We use two main query packs:

1. **security-and-quality** - Basic security and code quality checks
2. **security-extended** - Additional security-focused checks

## Interpreting Results

### Security Alert Severity

CodeQL alerts are categorized by severity:

- **Critical** - Immediate action required; potential for direct exploitation
- **High** - Should be addressed promptly; clear security implications
- **Medium** - Important to fix but with lower risk
- **Low** - Minor issues that should be addressed when convenient

### Common Alert Types

1. **Injection Vulnerabilities** - SQL, command, or path injection issues
2. **Insecure Data Handling** - Improper encryption, data exposure
3. **Authentication Issues** - Weak password handling, session management problems
4. **Resource Management** - Memory leaks, unbounded allocation
5. **API Misuse** - Incorrect use of security-sensitive APIs

### False Positives

CodeQL may flag issues that aren't actual vulnerabilities in context. Review each alert carefully:

1. Check if the code is in a test file or mock (these should be excluded)
2. Verify if there are existing sanitization or validation mechanisms
3. Consider the execution context and whether the issue is exploitable

## Running Locally

You can run CodeQL analysis locally for faster feedback:

1. Install the CodeQL CLI from GitHub
2. Clone the repository and set up the database:
   ```bash
   codeql database create skidbladnir-db --language=javascript,python,go
   ```
3. Run analysis:
   ```bash
   codeql database analyze skidbladnir-db --format=sarif-latest --output=results.sarif
   ```

## Responding to Alerts

When CodeQL identifies an issue:

1. **Assess** - Determine if it's a true positive and its severity
2. **Prioritize** - Address critical and high issues first
3. **Fix** - Implement a secure solution according to best practices
4. **Verify** - Run a new scan to ensure the issue is resolved
5. **Document** - Note any architectural decisions or context in code comments

## Best Practices

1. **Fix Issues Early** - Address security issues as soon as they're identified
2. **Regular Reviews** - Check the Security tab weekly for new alerts
3. **Security-First Development** - Consider security implications while coding
4. **Update Exclusions** - Refine the CodeQL configuration as needed

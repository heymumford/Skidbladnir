# qTest Loader Error Handling Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for testing the error handling capabilities of the qTest loader. The qTest loader must gracefully handle various error scenarios that may occur during data loading operations.

## Authentication Error Scenarios
1. **Invalid API Token**
   - Test when the API token is invalid, expired, or malformed
   - Expected behavior: Return appropriate authentication error with clear message
   - Recovery strategy: Prompt for token refresh

2. **Authorization Failure**
   - Test when the user lacks permissions for certain operations
   - Expected behavior: Return proper 403 error with permission details
   - Recovery strategy: Log error details and suggest permission escalation

3. **Token Expiration During Operation**
   - Test when token expires mid-operation
   - Expected behavior: Detect expiration, attempt token refresh
   - Recovery strategy: If refresh fails, preserve operation state for resumption

## Network Error Scenarios
1. **Connection Timeout**
   - Test behavior when connection times out
   - Expected behavior: Retry with exponential backoff
   - Recovery strategy: Maximum retry attempts before failing gracefully

2. **Server Unavailable (5xx errors)**
   - Test behavior when server returns 5xx errors
   - Expected behavior: Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable server errors
   - Recovery strategy: Retry for transient errors, abort for critical server failures

3. **Invalid SSL Certificate**
   - Test behavior with invalid SSL certificates
   - Expected behavior: Proper error message with certificate details
   - Recovery strategy: Option to bypass in non-production environments with explicit approval

## API Constraint Errors
1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Test behavior when hitting API rate limits
   - Expected behavior: Detect rate limit headers, pause operations
   - Recovery strategy: Implement adaptive rate limiting based on server response

2. **Payload Size Limits**
   - Test with oversized payloads (attachments, large batches)
   - Expected behavior: Detect payload constraints before sending
   - Recovery strategy: Chunk data into acceptable sizes

3. **API Version Compatibility**
   - Test with endpoints that change behavior across API versions
   - Expected behavior: Version detection and compatibility checking
   - Recovery strategy: Adapt request format based on detected API version

## Data Validation Errors
1. **Required Field Missing**
   - Test when required fields are missing in input data
   - Expected behavior: Validate before sending, provide field-specific errors
   - Recovery strategy: Clear error messages identifying missing fields

2. **Invalid Field Format**
   - Test with malformed data (invalid dates, IDs, etc.)
   - Expected behavior: Field-level validation with specific format errors
   - Recovery strategy: Attempt data normalization where possible

3. **Referential Integrity Errors**
   - Test with invalid references (non-existent parent IDs, etc.)
   - Expected behavior: Identify invalid references before submission
   - Recovery strategy: Log detailed reference errors, suggest resolution steps

## Resource Conflict Errors
1. **Duplicate Resources**
   - Test when attempting to create duplicate resources
   - Expected behavior: Detect 409 Conflict responses
   - Recovery strategy: Offer merge, update, or skip options

2. **Concurrent Modification**
   - Test when resources are modified concurrently
   - Expected behavior: Detect stale data using ETags or version fields
   - Recovery strategy: Retrieve latest version and reattempt operation

3. **Resource Lock Conflicts**
   - Test when resources are locked by other operations
   - Expected behavior: Detect lock conflicts
   - Recovery strategy: Implement waiting pattern with timeout

## Complex Operation Failures
1. **Partial Batch Failures**
   - Test bulk operations where some items succeed and others fail
   - Expected behavior: Track individual item status, continue processing
   - Recovery strategy: Detailed report of successes and failures, resume capability

2. **Dependent Operation Chains**
   - Test failures in multi-step operations with dependencies
   - Expected behavior: Rollback capability for dependent operations
   - Recovery strategy: Transaction-like semantics where possible

3. **Attachment Processing Errors**
   - Test specific errors for binary content processing
   - Expected behavior: Detailed error information about attachment issues
   - Recovery strategy: Retry attachment operations independently from metadata

## State Management During Errors
1. **Operation Resumability**
   - Test ability to resume operations after failure
   - Expected behavior: Persistent state that survives process restarts
   - Recovery strategy: Checkpoint-based resumption

2. **Data Consistency During Failures**
   - Test data consistency when operations are interrupted
   - Expected behavior: Partial updates should not create invalid states
   - Recovery strategy: Validate resulting data state after recovery

3. **Cleanup After Critical Failures**
   - Test resource cleanup after unrecoverable errors
   - Expected behavior: No orphaned or leaked resources
   - Recovery strategy: Register cleanup handlers for critical operations

## Error Reporting Requirements
1. **Structured Error Format**
   - Test that errors are returned in consistent, parseable format
   - Expected behavior: Standard error structure with code, message, details
   - Implementation: Error registry with standardized formatting

2. **Contextual Error Information**
   - Test that errors include operation context
   - Expected behavior: Include resources being processed, operation type
   - Implementation: Error context propagation

3. **Error Categorization**
   - Test that errors are properly categorized
   - Expected behavior: Errors grouped by type (auth, network, validation)
   - Implementation: Error hierarchy with inheritance

## Special API Considerations for qTest
1. **Module-specific Error Handling**
   - Test for differences in error formats across modules (Requirements, Test Cases, etc.)
   - Expected behavior: Module-specific error handlers
   - Implementation: Module-aware error processing

2. **Parent-Child Relationship Errors**
   - Test for hierarchical data integrity errors specific to qTest
   - Expected behavior: Validate parent-child relationships before submission
   - Implementation: Relationship validators

3. **Field Type Conversion Errors**
   - Test for errors in field type mappings specific to qTest's custom fields
   - Expected behavior: Field-type specific validation and conversion
   - Implementation: Type-aware field processors

## Test Coverage Requirements
1. Each error scenario must have:
   - Unit tests with mocked API responses
   - Integration tests with real API endpoints where possible
   - Negative test cases ensuring errors are properly caught
   - Recovery test cases verifying system can recover from errors

2. Test data should include:
   - Boundary values
   - Malformed input
   - Edge cases specific to qTest API

3. Test environments should cover:
   - Production-like environment
   - High-latency network simulation
   - Intermittent connection simulation

# Skíðblaðnir Security Audit Guidelines

This document serves as a reference for security audit investigators who need to assess Skíðblaðnir for corporate use approval. It outlines the key areas of data handling, security controls, and compliance considerations.

## Data Handling Questionnaire

### 1. Data Collection and Storage

- **Q1.1**: What types of data does Skíðblaðnir collect and process during test asset migration?
  - *Current Status*: Skíðblaðnir collects test case metadata, test steps, test results, execution data, and attachments from source systems.

- **Q1.2**: Where is data stored during and after migration processes?
  - *Current Status*: Data is temporarily stored in container memory and temporary storage during processing. PostgreSQL maintains migration state. MinIO stores binary attachments temporarily.

- **Q1.3**: Is any data retained after migration completion?
  - *Current Status*: By default, all temporary data is purged upon migration completion. Logs are retained for audit purposes.

- **Q1.4**: How are attachments and binary data handled?
  - *Current Status*: Stored temporarily in MinIO with encryption at rest, transferred directly between source and target systems.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

- **Q2.1**: How does Skíðblaðnir authenticate to source and target systems?
  - *Current Status*: OAuth2, API keys, or basic authentication depending on provider capabilities. Credentials are stored encrypted.

- **Q2.2**: How are credentials managed and stored?
  - *Current Status*: Credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256. In memory credentials are never logged.

- **Q2.3**: What authorization controls exist for different operations?
  - *Current Status*: Local-only access. Container is designed to run in secure environments with existing network controls.

- **Q2.4**: Does the application support single sign-on (SSO) integration?
  - *Current Status*: No SSO for the application itself as it's container-based. Authentication to providers supports OAuth2.

### 3. Encryption and Data Protection

- **Q3.1**: How is data encrypted in transit and at rest?
  - *Current Status*: TLS 1.2+ for all API communications. AES-256 encryption for temporary stored data and credentials.

- **Q3.2**: What key management practices are implemented?
  - *Current Status*: Encryption keys are generated per container instance and stored in memory only.

- **Q3.3**: How are API tokens and secrets managed?
  - *Current Status*: Encrypted in container storage, never exposed in logs or error messages.

- **Q3.4**: Is data anonymized or pseudonymized at any point?
  - *Current Status*: No automatic anonymization. Tool processes data as-is between systems.

### 4. Logging and Auditing

- **Q4.1**: What events are logged by the system?
  - *Current Status*: All operations including API calls, authentication attempts, data access, and transformations.

- **Q4.2**: How long are logs retained?
  - *Current Status*: Logs are retained for the duration of the container session by default. Exportable for longer retention.

- **Q4.3**: How are logs protected from tampering?
  - *Current Status*: Logs are append-only within the container context. No direct modification mechanisms.

- **Q4.4**: Can logs be exported to SIEM systems?
  - *Current Status*: Logs can be exported in JSON format for ingestion into SIEM systems.

### 5. Compliance and Regulations

- **Q5.1**: How does Skíðblaðnir support GDPR compliance?
  - *Current Status*: Temporary data storage with purge capabilities. No unnecessary data retention.

- **Q5.2**: Is Skíðblaðnir compliant with industry standards (ISO 27001, SOC2, etc.)?
  - *Current Status*: Designed with security best practices. Not formally certified.

- **Q5.3**: How are data residency requirements addressed?
  - *Current Status*: Local container execution ensures data remains within corporate infrastructure.

- **Q5.4**: How is data deletion/purging handled when required?
  - *Current Status*: Data purge commands available via UI. Automatic cleanup post-migration.

### 6. Vulnerability Management

- **Q6.1**: How are dependencies managed and updated?
  - *Current Status*: Container builds include dependency scanning. Regular updates to base images.

- **Q6.2**: What vulnerability scanning practices are in place?
  - *Current Status*: Container images scanned before deployment. Dependencies checked against vulnerability databases.

- **Q6.3**: How are security patches managed?
  - *Current Status*: Regular container rebuilds with latest security patches.

- **Q6.4**: Has the application undergone penetration testing?
  - *Current Status*: Initial architecture review for security concerns. No formal penetration testing yet.

### 7. AI/LLM Specific Security Considerations

- **Q7.1**: How is the local LLM secured against prompt injection attacks?
  - *Current Status*: Input validation, context restrictions, and sandbox execution for the LLM component.

- **Q7.2**: What data is the LLM trained on or given access to?
  - *Current Status*: LLM is provided with API documentation and error patterns only. No access to migration data.

- **Q7.3**: How is the LLM output validated before being acted upon?
  - *Current Status*: LLM suggestions for API troubleshooting require explicit user confirmation before execution.

### 8. Container Security

- **Q8.1**: How are container images secured and verified?
  - *Current Status*: Signed container images. Minimal base images with reduced attack surface.

- **Q8.2**: What isolation mechanisms are implemented?
  - *Current Status*: Standard container isolation. No privileged execution required.

- **Q8.3**: How are container secrets managed?
  - *Current Status*: Secrets passed via environment variables or mounted volumes, not baked into images.

- **Q8.4**: What network security controls are implemented at the container level?
  - *Current Status*: Minimal exposed ports. No unnecessary network services.

# Zephyr Scale to qTest Migration Demo

## Overview

This document outlines the working demo we've created to showcase the Zephyr Scale to qTest migration workflow. The demo demonstrates the complete process including:

1. Connecting to both systems using API tokens
2. Retrieving test cases from Zephyr Scale
3. Transforming the test case data to the qTest format
4. Creating the test cases in qTest
5. Transferring all attachments
6. Verifying the migration results

## Demo Components

The demonstration consists of several key components:

### User Interface

- Interactive connection panels for both Zephyr Scale and qTest
- Real-time migration status indicator showing all phases of the migration process
- Detailed visualizations of both source and target test cases
- Field-by-field transformation visualization showing how data is mapped and transformed

### Transformations

The demo showcases various types of transformations including:

- Direct field mappings (e.g., name → name, description → description)
- Value transformations (e.g., status "ACTIVE" → "Ready", priority "HIGH" → "P1")
- Structure transformations (e.g., Zephyr steps → qTest test_steps, labels → tags)
- Complex transformations (field concatenation, data type conversions)

### Test Case Visualization

Comprehensive test case visualization includes:

- View source Zephyr Scale test case with all fields
- View target qTest test case after transformation
- Side-by-side comparison of field mappings
- Raw data view showing complete JSON structures

## Using the Demo

To access the demo:

1. Navigate to the `/zephyr-qtest-demo` route in the application
2. Click "Connect" on both the Zephyr Scale and qTest connection panels 
3. Click "Start Migration" to begin the demonstration
4. Use the tabs to explore different aspects of the transformation

## Technical Implementation

The demo includes:

- Simulated API connections to both Zephyr Scale and qTest
- Sample test case data representing real-world structures
- Complete transformation engine with support for various mapping types
- Interactive UI components for visualizing the migration process

## Notes for Production Use

When moving from the demo to production:

1. Replace mock API connections with real API tokens
2. Configure field mappings specific to your instance
3. Set up batch processing for larger migrations
4. Consider implementing custom transformations for special fields

The concepts demonstrated in this demo apply directly to real migration scenarios, with the only difference being the use of actual API connections instead of simulated ones.

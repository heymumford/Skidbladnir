# User Interface Documentation

This directory contains documentation about Skidbladnir's user interface design, implementation, and testing.

## UI Design Documents

- [Design System](design-system.md) - Core design system principles and components
- [LCARS Design System](lcars-design-system.md) - Star Trek inspired interface design system
- [User Interface Guide](user-interface-guide.md) - Guide to using the interface

## UI Components and Features

Skidbladnir's user interface includes several specialized components:

### Provider Configuration
- Connection setup for Zephyr, qTest, and other providers
- API key management
- Connection testing and validation

### Transformation Interface
- Field mapping between providers
- Transformation preview
- Data structure comparison

### Migration Control
- Execution configuration
- Start/pause/resume/cancel controls
- Progress monitoring

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time migration status
- Operation dependency visualization
- Performance metrics

### Error Handling
- Detailed error reporting
- Remediation suggestions
- API error analysis

## LCARS Design System

The LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) design is inspired by Star Trek interfaces and features:

- Asymmetric panels and layouts
- Distinctive color coding for different system functions
- Status indicators with blinking lights for active operations
- Touch-optimized large controls
- Ambient system status through colors and animations

## Implementation Technologies

The UI is built with:
- **React**: Component library
- **Material-UI**: Base component framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe implementation
- **CSS-in-JS**: Styled components
- **React Router**: Navigation
- **i18next**: Internationalization

## Accessibility Features

The UI is designed with accessibility in mind:
- WCAG AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance
- Responsive design

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

The UI is tested and compatible with:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari

## UI Testing

The UI components are thoroughly tested using:
- **Jest**: Unit testing
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **Cypress**: End-to-end and cross-browser testing
- **jest-axe**: Accessibility testing

## UI Workflow

The standard migration workflow consists of:

1. **Provider Configuration**
   - Configure source provider (Zephyr)
   - Configure destination provider (qTest)
   - Test connections

2. **Transformation Setup**
   - Map fields between providers
   - Configure transformations
   - Preview transformed data

3. **Migration Execution**
   - Configure migration options
   - Start migration
   - Monitor progress

4. **Review and Verification**
   - Verify migration results
   - Address any errors or warnings
   - Generate migration report

# Skíðblaðnir Test-Driven Development Approach

This document outlines the comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for all components of the Skíðblaðnir system, ensuring quality, maintainability, and adherence to the Clean Architecture principles.

## Core TDD Principles

1. **Tests First, Always**: All code must have tests written before implementation.
2. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Follow the classic TDD cycle rigorously.
3. **Clean Architecture Validation**: Tests validate adherence to architectural boundaries.
4. **Acceptance Criteria First**: Define acceptance criteria before any development begins.
5. **Continuous Integration**: All tests must pass on every commit.

## Testing Layers

### 1. Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests define the behavior of the system from a user's perspective and serve as the primary specification for features.

**Process**:
1. Write acceptance tests based on user stories and requirements
2. Define acceptance criteria in a BDD-style format (Given-When-Then)
3. Implement the tests using a BDD framework
4. Run tests continuously during development to validate progress
5. Only consider a feature complete when all acceptance tests pass

**Tools**:
- Jest + Cucumber for BDD-style tests
- Cypress for UI acceptance testing
- Supertest for API testing

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly and respect architectural boundaries.

**Process**:
1. Define integration test cases for each architectural boundary
2. Test all provider interfaces against their contracts
3. Verify that communication between architectural layers follows Clean Architecture rules
4. Ensure data flows correctly between components

**Tools**:
- Jest for TypeScript/JavaScript components
- Pytest for Python components
- Go testing framework for Go components

### 3. Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the behavior of individual components in isolation.

**Process**:
1. Define the interface and behavior of the component before implementation
2. Write tests that validate all aspects of the component's contract
3. Use mocks to isolate the component from its dependencies
4. Implement the component to pass the tests
5. Refactor while keeping tests passing

**Tools**:
- Jest for TypeScript components
- React Testing Library for UI components
- Pytest for Python components
- Go testing framework for Go components

## TDD Workflow for Clean Architecture

### Domain Layer

1. Write tests for domain entities and use cases
2. Ensure domain models are free from infrastructure concerns
3. Validate business rules through tests
4. Implement domain logic to satisfy tests

### Use Case / Application Layer

1. Write tests that define the behavior of use cases
2. Mock out infrastructure dependencies
3. Validate that use cases orchestrate domain entities correctly
4. Implement use cases to satisfy tests

### Interface Adapters

1. Write tests for controllers, presenters, and gateways
2. Ensure adapters correctly translate between domain and external formats
3. Validate that adapters respect architectural boundaries
4. Implement adapters to satisfy tests

### Infrastructure Layer

1. Write tests for infrastructure components against their interfaces
2. Ensure infrastructure correctly implements adapter interfaces
3. Use integration tests to validate real infrastructure behavior
4. Implement infrastructure to satisfy tests

## Plugin-Based Architecture Testing

### Provider Plugin Tests

1. Define contract tests that all providers must satisfy
2. Create test fixtures for provider-specific functionality
3. Implement shared test suites that all providers must pass
4. Create provider-specific test extensions

### Test Doubles Strategy

1. Create mock implementations of all provider interfaces
2. Use test doubles for infrastructure during domain and use case testing
3. Implement simulators for external systems
4. Create test fixtures for common testing scenarios

## UI Testing Strategy

### Component Tests

1. Define behavior of UI components through tests
2. Mock all backend dependencies
3. Test component rendering and interactions
4. Validate accessibility requirements

### Integration Tests

1. Test interactions between components
2. Validate navigation and workflow
3. Test error handling and edge cases

### End-to-End Tests

1. Define critical user journeys
2. Test complete workflows from user perspective
3. Validate system behavior as a whole

## Continuous Testing

1. Run unit tests on every commit
2. Run integration tests on every push
3. Run acceptance tests on every branch merge
4. Generate test coverage reports
5. Enforce minimum test coverage thresholds

## Test Quality Assurance

1. Peer review all tests
2. Refactor tests to improve clarity and maintenance
3. Document test failures and fixes
4. Evaluate and improve test coverage regularly

## Test Environment Management

1. Use containerization for consistent test environments
2. Create test-specific configurations
3. Implement database reset between test runs
4. Use test data factories for consistent test data

## Specialized Testing Approaches

### API Bridge Testing

1. Test API specification parsing
2. Validate session management
3. Test authentication flows
4. Verify error recovery mechanisms
5. Test rate limiting behavior

### LLM Integration Testing

1. Test LLM prompts and responses
2. Validate security boundaries
3. Test error handling
4. Benchmark performance

### Migration Process Testing

1. Test extraction from source systems
2. Validate transformation logic
3. Test loading into target systems
4. Verify data integrity throughout the process
5. Test resumability

## Test Documentation

Each test must be well-documented:

1. Purpose of the test
2. Preconditions
3. Expected behavior
4. Edge cases covered
5. Architectural validations

## Implementation Schedule

The implementation will follow this TDD schedule:

1. Establish testing frameworks and infrastructure
2. Implement domain entity tests
3. Implement use case tests
4. Implement interface adapter tests
5. Implement infrastructure tests
6. Implement acceptance tests
7. Implement UI component tests
8. Implement end-to-end tests

No component will be considered ready for implementation until its tests are defined, reviewed, and approved.

## Metrics and Monitoring

The TDD approach will be monitored using these metrics:

1. Test coverage percentage (aim for >90%)
2. Test-to-code ratio
3. Time between test authoring and implementation
4. Test failure rate
5. Test execution time

## TDD Culture

This project will foster a strong TDD culture:

1. TDD training for all team members
2. Regular TDD pairing sessions
3. TDD showcases and knowledge sharing
4. Test quality reviews
5. Celebration of good testing practices

By following this comprehensive TDD approach, Skíðblaðnir will achieve high quality, maintainable code that correctly implements Clean Architecture principles and meets all requirements.

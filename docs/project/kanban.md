# Skíðblaðnir: Universal Test Asset Migration Kanban

## North Star Direction
Our primary "north star" for implementation is to use Zephyr Scale as our source and qTest as our destination for test case migrations. This focus provides a clear demonstration of how other sources and destinations should be configured in the future. While we're building an open architecture that will support other products, we're prioritizing the Zephyr → qTest workflow for our initial implementation.

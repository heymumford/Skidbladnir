# Zephyr to qTest Migration: Our Primary Focus

## North Star Direction

Skidbladnir's primary "north star" for implementation is to use **Atlassian Jira with Zephyr Scale as our source** and **Tricentis qTest as our destination** for test case migrations. This focused approach provides a clear demonstration of how other sources and destinations should be configured in the future.

## Why Zephyr Scale to qTest?

1. **Market Demand**: Many organizations are transitioning from Jira/Zephyr to qTest
2. **API Complexity**: Both systems have complex APIs that represent the challenges in this domain
3. **Schema Differences**: Significant differences in test case structure require robust transformation
4. **Attachment Handling**: Both systems support attachments but with different approaches
5. **Real-world Relevance**: This path provides immediate value to many teams

## Implementation Prioritization

While we're building an open architecture that will support other providers in the future (such as HP ALM/Quality Center, Azure DevOps, and Rally), we are prioritizing the Zephyr→qTest workflow for our initial implementation to ensure it works flawlessly before expanding.

### Current Focus Areas

- **Zephyr Scale API**: Complete, robust implementation of all required endpoints
- **qTest APIs**: Comprehensive coverage of qTest Manager, Parameters, and Scenarios APIs
- **Field Mapping**: Intelligent, configurable mapping between Zephyr and qTest fields
- **Attachment Processing**: Binary handling for test artifacts
- **Dependency Management**: Operation execution ordering for complex workflows
- **Workflow Visualization**: Clear, real-time status displays for migration progress

### Future Providers

Our architecture is designed to support additional providers with minimal changes:

1. **Provider Interface**: All providers implement the same interface
2. **Canonical Model**: The internal representation is provider-agnostic
3. **Plug-in Architecture**: New providers can be added without modifying core code
4. **Open Documentation**: Well-documented extension points for community contributions

## Components Specific to Zephyr→qTest Migration

1. **Zephyr Extractor**
   - Handles Zephyr Scale's REST API structure
   - Supports all test case data types
   - Manages authentication with Jira/Zephyr
   - Extracts attachments and metadata

2. **qTest Loader**
   - Implements qTest Manager API for test assets
   - Supports qTest Parameters for parameterized testing
   - Handles qTest Scenarios for BDD-style tests
   - Manages test cycles and executions

3. **Field Transformation**
   - Maps Zephyr fields to qTest equivalents
   - Handles custom field mapping
   - Preserves relationships between test assets
   - Maintains trace links and references

4. **API Operation Dependencies**
   - Ensures Zephyr operations happen in logical sequence
   - Controls qTest operations based on dependencies
   - Provides visualization of the dependency graph
   - Maintains cross-system operation ordering

## Testing Strategy

Our testing specifically validates the Zephyr→qTest path:

1. **API Contract Tests**: Verify API contracts for both providers
2. **Integration Tests**: Validate end-to-end migration flows
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure handling of large migration volumes
4. **Error Recovery**: Test resilience and self-healing capabilities

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation focuses on the Zephyr→qTest workflow:

1. **Setup Guides**: Step-by-step configuration for both systems
2. **Field Mapping Guide**: Detailed explanation of field transformations
3. **API References**: Complete API documentation for both systems
4. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions specific to this migration path

## Conclusion

By focusing on the Zephyr→qTest migration path, we provide a clear and valuable implementation that demonstrates our architecture's capabilities. This focused approach ensures we deliver a high-quality solution for a specific, in-demand use case while establishing the patterns for future provider implementations.

# Test-Driven Development Approach for Skíðblaðnir

This document outlines the comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for all components of the Skíðblaðnir system, ensuring quality, maintainability, and adherence to the Clean Architecture principles.

## Core TDD Principles

1. **Tests First, Always**: All code must have tests written before implementation
2. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Follow the classic TDD cycle rigorously
3. **Clean Architecture Validation**: Tests validate adherence to architectural boundaries
4. **Acceptance Criteria First**: Define acceptance criteria before any development begins
5. **Continuous Integration**: All tests must pass on every commit

## TDD Tooling Strategy

### TypeScript/Node.js Components
- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **ts-mockito**: For mocking interfaces and dependencies
- **nock**: For HTTP request interception and API simulation
- **supertest**: For API integration testing

### Python Components
- **pytest**: Core testing framework
- **pytest-mock**: For dependency mocking
- **pytest-asyncio**: For async test support
- **responses**: For HTTP mocking
- **hypothesis**: For property-based testing

### Go Components
- **testing**: Standard Go testing package
- **testify**: For assertions and test structuring
- **gomock**: For interface mocking
- **httptest**: For API testing

### Database Testing
- **testcontainers**: For spinning up isolated database instances
- **pg_timetable**: For testing time-dependent processes
- **MockRedis**: For Redis testing

## Testing Layers

### 1. Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests define the behavior of the system from a user's perspective and serve as the primary specification for features.

**Process**:
1. Write acceptance tests based on user stories and requirements
2. Define acceptance criteria in a BDD-style format (Given-When-Then)
3. Implement the tests using a BDD framework
4. Run tests continuously during development to validate progress
5. Only consider a feature complete when all acceptance tests pass

**Tools**:
- Jest + Cucumber for BDD-style tests
- Cypress for UI acceptance testing
- Supertest for API testing

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly and respect architectural boundaries.

**Process**:
1. Define integration test cases for each architectural boundary
2. Test all provider interfaces against their contracts
3. Verify that communication between architectural layers follows Clean Architecture rules
4. Ensure data flows correctly between components

### 3. Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the behavior of individual components in isolation.

**Process**:
1. Define the interface and behavior of the component before implementation
2. Write tests that validate all aspects of the component's contract
3. Use mocks to isolate the component from its dependencies
4. Implement the component to pass the tests
5. Refactor while keeping tests passing

## TDD Workflow for Clean Architecture

### Domain Layer

1. Write tests for domain entities and use cases
2. Ensure domain models are free from infrastructure concerns
3. Validate business rules through tests
4. Implement domain logic to satisfy tests

### Use Case / Application Layer

1. Write tests that define the behavior of use cases
2. Mock out infrastructure dependencies
3. Validate that use cases orchestrate domain entities correctly
4. Implement use cases to satisfy tests

### Interface Adapters

1. Write tests for controllers, presenters, and gateways
2. Ensure adapters correctly translate between domain and external formats
3. Validate that adapters respect architectural boundaries
4. Implement adapters to satisfy tests

### Infrastructure Layer

1. Write tests for infrastructure components against their interfaces
2. Ensure infrastructure correctly implements adapter interfaces
3. Use integration tests to validate real infrastructure behavior
4. Implement infrastructure to satisfy tests

## Special Testing Considerations

- **API Rate Limiting**: Test throttling behavior
- **Failure Recovery**: Verify retry mechanisms
- **Data Volume**: Test with scaled dataset samples
- **Performance**: Validate throughput under load
- **Concurrency**: Test parallel operation safety

## Testing Patterns

- Use test fixtures for standard data
- Implement test data factories
- Create API simulators for test management systems
- Use snapshot testing for complex transformations
- Implement property-based testing for data mapping validation

## Continuous Testing

1. Run unit tests on every commit
2. Run integration tests on every push
3. Run acceptance tests on every branch merge
4. Generate test coverage reports
5. Enforce minimum test coverage thresholds (aim for >90%)

## Development Workflow

1. For each feature:
   - Write test specification first
   - Implement the feature until tests pass
   - Refactor while maintaining test coverage
   - Commit with tests and implementation together

2. For each component:
   - Define clear interfaces through contract tests
   - Enable parallel development through mocks
   - Integrate with real dependencies incrementally

3. For the overall system:
   - Build end-to-end tests for critical paths
   - Create test environments with representative data volumes
   - Validate performance characteristics regularly

## TDD Culture

This project fosters a strong TDD culture:

1. TDD training for all team members
2. Regular TDD pairing sessions
3. TDD showcases and knowledge sharing
4. Test quality reviews
5. Celebration of good testing practices

By following this comprehensive TDD approach, Skíðblaðnir will achieve high quality, maintainable code that correctly implements Clean Architecture principles and meets all requirements.

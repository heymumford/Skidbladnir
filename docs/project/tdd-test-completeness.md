# TDD Test Completeness Metrics

This document outlines the criteria and metrics used to determine the completeness of tests in our Test-Driven Development (TDD) process. These metrics ensure that our tests fully cover both functional requirements and Clean Architecture boundaries.

## Core Completeness Criteria

Every test suite must achieve completeness across the following dimensions:

### 1. Functional Completeness

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Requirements Coverage** | Percentage of requirements covered by tests | 100% |
| **Edge Case Coverage** | Percentage of identified edge cases with tests | ≥ 95% |
| **Happy Path Coverage** | Primary success paths covered | 100% |
| **Failure Path Coverage** | Expected failure scenarios covered | ≥ 90% |
| **Input Boundary Testing** | Tests for min/max/boundary values | Required |
| **Performance Criteria** | Tests for performance requirements | Required for critical paths |

### 2. Architectural Completeness

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Dependency Inversion** | Tests verify interfaces used instead of implementations | Required |
| **Layer Independence** | Tests verify domain layer has no external dependencies | Required |
| **Boundary Protection** | Tests verify proper data transformation across boundaries | Required |
| **Port Coverage** | Primary ports have complete adapter test suites | 100% |
| **Clean Architecture Validation** | Tests that explicitly verify architectural rules | Required |

### 3. Code Coverage Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Line Coverage** | Percentage of code lines executed by tests | ≥ 90% |
| **Branch Coverage** | Percentage of code branches executed by tests | ≥ 85% |
| **Function Coverage** | Percentage of functions called by tests | ≥ 95% |
| **Layer-Specific Coverage** | Coverage percentages by architectural layer | Domain Layer: ≥ 95%<br>Use Cases: ≥ 90%<br>Adapters: ≥ 85%<br>Infrastructure: ≥ 80% |

## Test Thoroughness Evaluation

Each test suite should be evaluated for thoroughness using the following criteria:

### 1. Test Isolation

- **Mock Usage**: Appropriate use of mocks for external dependencies
- **Test Independence**: Tests work independently without shared state
- **Environmental Independence**: Tests run consistently in any environment

### 2. Test Specificity

- **Single Responsibility**: Each test verifies one specific aspect
- **Clear Intent**: Test names and structure clearly indicate what is being tested
- **Behavior Focus**: Tests focus on behavior not implementation details

### 3. Test Reliability

- **Determinism**: Tests produce consistent results on repeated runs
- **Timeouts**: Tests handle async operations properly
- **Resource Cleanup**: Tests properly release resources

## Determining Test Completeness by Layer

Each layer of the Clean Architecture has specific completeness criteria:

### Domain Layer Tests

A complete domain layer test suite should:

1. Verify all business rules and invariants
2. Test all entity operations and transformations
3. Verify value object immutability and validation
4. Test domain service behavior without infrastructure dependencies
5. Validate entity relationships and aggregate boundaries
6. Test domain events if applicable

### Use Case / Application Layer Tests

A complete use case test suite should:

1. Mock out all infrastructure dependencies
2. Verify correct orchestration of domain entities
3. Test all success and failure paths
4. Verify proper handling of domain events
5. Test transaction boundaries if applicable
6. Verify that use cases interact only with the domain layer and port interfaces

### Interface Adapter Tests

A complete adapter test suite should:

1. Test proper translation between domain and external formats
2. Verify that adapters respect architectural boundaries
3. Test adapter-specific error handling
4. Verify that adapters pass correct data to ports
5. Test controller request handling and response formatting
6. Verify presenter formatting logic

### Infrastructure Layer Tests

A complete infrastructure test suite should:

1. Test against interface contracts defined in the adapter layer
2. Include integration tests for real infrastructure behavior
3. Test error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Verify proper resource management
5. Test configuration handling
6. Include performance and load tests where applicable

## Test Completion Checklist

Before considering a feature complete, the following checklist must be satisfied:

- [ ] Acceptance tests for all user-facing functionality pass
- [ ] Unit tests for all components pass
- [ ] Integration tests for component interactions pass
- [ ] Architecture validation tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- [ ] Performance tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Concurrency tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Security tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Edge case tests pass
- [ ] Test code has been reviewed for quality

## Test Quality Metrics

In addition to completeness, test quality should be evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Test-to-Code Ratio**: Ratio of test code to production code
2. **Test Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity of test code
3. **Setup-to-Assertion Ratio**: Ratio of setup code to assertion code
4. **Test Run Time**: Time to execute the test suite
5. **Test Fragility**: Frequency of test failures due to non-functional changes

## Implementing TDD Metrics in the Project

To implement these metrics in the project, we will:

1. Create a test metrics collector that runs during CI/CD
2. Implement a test coverage visualization dashboard
3. Create automated architectural validation tools
4. Establish test quality review processes
5. Develop a test completeness reporting tool

By following these criteria and metrics, we ensure that our TDD approach leads to robust, maintainable code that correctly implements Clean Architecture principles and meets all requirements.

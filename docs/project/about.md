## About

Skidbladnir represents an innovative solution to the complex challenge of test asset migration between disparate systems. Born from the frustration of manual data transfer processes that consume countless engineering hours, this platform automates and optimizes the movement of test cases, cycles, and results across industry-standard test management tools.

With a foundation in clean architecture principles and powered by modern containerization practices, Skidbladnir combines technical excellence with practical utility. Its unique integration of local LLM capabilities provides self-healing mechanisms for API interactions, while the LCARS-inspired interface elevates the user experience beyond typical enterprise tools.

The project embodies the spirit of its Norse namesakeâ€”carrying valuable cargo efficiently across boundaries while adapting to different environments. Whether you're migrating thousands of test cases between enterprise systems or need a reliable bridge for continuous integration between tools, Skidbladnir delivers the stability and flexibility required for modern QA operations.

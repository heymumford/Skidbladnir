# Execution Control Components Tests

This directory contains tests for the execution control components in the Skidbladnir UI:

- `ExecutionControlInterface.test.tsx`: Tests for the comprehensive execution control UI component
- `ExecutionControlPanel.test.tsx`: Tests for the simpler execution control panel component
- `ExecutionPage.test.tsx`: Tests for the execution page that integrates these components

## Running Tests

To run these tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run all execution control tests
npx jest tests/unit/ui/execution --setupFilesAfterEnv=./tests/unit/ui/execution/setup.js --env=jsdom

# Run a specific test file
npx jest tests/unit/ui/execution/ExecutionControlInterface.test.tsx --setupFilesAfterEnv=./tests/unit/ui/execution/setup.js --env=jsdom
```

## Test Results

### ExecutionControlInterface.test.tsx
- All 15 tests passing

### ExecutionControlPanel.test.tsx
- All 14 tests passing

### ExecutionPage.test.tsx
- 1 test passing
- 8 tests failing (more complex issues with mocking Material-UI components like Chip, Grid, etc.)

## Issues and Future Improvements

1. Text matching issues:
   - Some tests are looking for exact text content that is rendered differently in the actual component.
   - Solution: Use regular expressions or partial text matching instead of exact matches.

2. Material-UI mocking:
   - The ExecutionPage test has issues with mocking Material-UI components like Chip, Grid, etc.
   - Solution: Enhance the mock setup to include these components or refactor the tests to use a different approach.

3. DOM Environment:
   - These tests require the jsdom environment to render React components.
   - Solution: Add `@jest-environment jsdom` to each test file and ensure setup files are properly configured.

4. Jest DOM Extensions:
   - These tests use matchers like `toBeInTheDocument()` from `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
   - Solution: Add the setup file to import these extensions.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the text matching issues in the existing tests
2. Improve the Material-UI component mocking for ExecutionPage.test.tsx
3. Add tests for additional functionality like error handling
4. Consider adding integration tests for the complete migration workflow

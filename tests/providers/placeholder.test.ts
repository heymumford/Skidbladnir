 * Provider Tests for Skidbladnir

 * Provider tests verify that each test management system adapter properly implements
 * the provider interface and correctly interacts with external systems.
 * 
 * This file serves as an entry point to the provider tests, which are now located in:
 * - tests/unit/providers/interfaces/ProviderInterface.test.ts - Interface compliance tests
 * - tests/unit/providers/ZephyrProvider.test.ts - Zephyr provider implementation tests
 * - tests/unit/providers/ProvidersAdapterCompliance.test.ts - All providers compliance tests

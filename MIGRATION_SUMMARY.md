# Migration Summary

This project has been consolidated from the previous TestBridge project into the current Skidbladnir structure.

## Changes Made

- Consolidated documentation from both projects
- Unified infrastructure with Podman-based containers
- Merged package structures
- Combined scripts from both projects
- Preserved the best features from both:
  - TestBridge's provider interface and containerization
  - Skidbladnir's LCARS interface and clean architecture

## Next Steps

1. Review the updated structure and ensure all components work as expected
2. Update the README.md to reflect the combined project features
3. Test the build, deployment, and container scripts
4. Remove the TestBridge directory once everything is verified
